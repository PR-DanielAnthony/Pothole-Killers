# Pothole Killers
Global Game Jam project made in 2020 using Unreal Engine 4. This project was later expanded, transitioned to the Unity engine, and published at the Google Play Store. My role was to develop the game as the sole programmer.

You play as an asphalt trucker tasked with covering the streets' potholes while avoiding other cars along the way. If you crash into another car, the game is over.

You move up and down between rows by pressing the `up/down arrow keys` respectively, and press the `space bar` to shoot your asphalt. Aim for the high score!
